se is the standard error from the lienar regression
Fitting Lotka-Volterra coefficients K and alpha through linear regression (assuming day 21 populations are at equilibrium
We assume the error is normally distributed - this seems close enough to true.

spec is the focal species
name is the coefficient name. In the cases where name is a species name, it's an alpha term, and the species named is the competing species
est is the estimate FOR LOTKA VOLTERRA MODEL. So the K is in units of individuals, and the other terms are the ALPHAs, which are the coefficient estimates times negative 1.
